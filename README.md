CepFácil
===========

Wrapper Ruby for the service at cepfacil.com.br

Installation
------------

In the `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem "cep_facil"
```

Or via RubyGems, directly:

  `gem install cep_facil`

CepFacil works only in Ruby 1.9.2 by default. If you need it to work with 1.8.7 you must do the following:

In the `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem "cep_facil", :git => "git://github.com/rodrigoalvesvieira/cep_facil.git", :branch => "1.8.7"
```

Usage
-----

### Fetching an address by zip code

```ruby
require "cep_facil"
cep = "53417-540"
token = "1234567890" # get yours at cepfacil.com.br
address = CepFacil.get_address(cep, token)
# Returns the address referent to that zip code.
address[:city]
# Returns the city referent to that zip code.
```

Alternatively, you can do:

```ruby
require "cep_facil"
include CepFacil
address = get_address cep, token
```

The response is a Hash object that contains 6 keys: cep, type, state, city, neighborhood, description.

There are three formats for one to store Brazilian zip codes (CEPs):

```ruby
"12345-678"
"12345678"
12345678   # I wouldn't use this one, really.
```

CepFácil works with the three of them.

### Using a custom dictionary
```ruby
dictionary = {
  "cidade" => :city,
  "descricao" => :street
}
address = CepFacil.get_address cep, token, dictionary
address[:street] # Returns the street referent to that zip code
```

### Displaying an address in full mode

```ruby
address = CepFacil.get_address(cep, token)
CepFacil.full address
```

Or:

````ruby
require "cep_facil"
include CepFacil

address = get_address("50050-000", token)
full(address) # => Rua da Aurora, Boa Vista, Recife-PE, Brasil.
```
